# Ethics & Limitations

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Anonymization
- All crime records are aggregated at the location level
- Individual victim identities are never stored or displayed
- Personal information is limited to age and gender for statistical analysis only

### User Data
- Personalization feature uses name, age, and gender for recommendations
- No user data is stored permanently
- All queries are processed in-memory and not logged

## Demographic Bias & Fairness

### Known Biases
1. **Reporting Bias**: Crime data reflects reported crimes, not actual crime rates
2. **Historical Bias**: Past policing patterns may be reflected in the data
3. **Demographic Skew**: Victim demographics may not represent population demographics

### Mitigation Strategies
- Transparent feature importance and SHAP explanations
- Configurable zone thresholds to avoid over-classification
- Demographic filters are optional and user-controlled
- Regular model audits for fairness across demographics

### Fairness Tradeoffs
The personalized safe-area finder uses demographic information to provide tailored recommendations. This involves tradeoffs:

**Benefits**:
- More relevant safety recommendations for vulnerable groups
- Awareness of demographic-specific crime patterns

**Risks**:
- Potential reinforcement of stereotypes
- Over-reliance on historical patterns
- May not account for unreported crimes

**Our Approach**:
- Demographic weighting is transparent and explainable
- Users can opt out of demographic filtering
- Recommendations include confidence scores and explanations
- Regular audits for disparate impact

## Limitations of Predictive Policing

### What This System Is NOT
- **Not a predictive policing tool**: We do not predict where crimes will occur for law enforcement
- **Not a substitute for judgment**: Predictions are probabilistic, not deterministic
- **Not comprehensive**: Only reflects reported crimes in the dataset

### What This System IS
- **A safety awareness tool**: Helps individuals make informed decisions
- **A trend analyzer**: Identifies patterns in historical crime data
- **A transparency mechanism**: Makes crime statistics accessible and understandable

## Responsible Use Guidelines

### For Users
1. Use predictions as one factor among many in decision-making
2. Understand that "safe" is relative and context-dependent
3. Report inaccuracies or concerns to administrators
4. Do not use for discriminatory purposes

### For Administrators
1. Regularly audit model performance across demographics
2. Update models with recent data to avoid staleness
3. Provide clear explanations of methodology to users
4. Monitor for misuse or unintended consequences

### For Developers
1. Document all modeling decisions and assumptions
2. Test for fairness across protected groups
3. Implement safeguards against adversarial use
4. Maintain transparency in feature engineering

## Data Retention & Deletion

- Raw crime data: Retained indefinitely for historical analysis
- Aggregated statistics: Retained indefinitely
- User queries: Not stored
- Model predictions: Cached for 30 days, then deleted

## Accountability

For questions, concerns, or to report issues:
- Open a GitHub issue
- Contact: [your-email@example.com]
- Review our [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY.md)

## Regular Audits

We commit to:
- Quarterly fairness audits across demographics
- Annual model retraining with updated data
- Transparent reporting of model performance
- Community feedback integration
